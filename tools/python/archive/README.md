# Archived Python Scripts

This directory contains old utility scripts that were used during development but are no longer actively needed.

## Why These Were Archived

Most of these scripts were one-off utilities for:

- Fixing syntax errors in bulk
- Converting old scenario formats
- Analyzing scenario data
- Expanding scenarios (before automated generator)

## Current Production Code

**Active Scripts:**

- `../scenario_generator.py` - Main scenario generator (branching narratives)
- `../logic_engine_ui.py` - Separate GUI tool for scenario expansion

## If You Need These

These scripts are archived for reference but may not work with current codebase structure. The functionality has been replaced by `scenario_generator.py`.
